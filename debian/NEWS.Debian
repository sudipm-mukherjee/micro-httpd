micro-httpd (20051212-5) unstable; urgency=low

  The binary name has changed from micro_httpd to the micro-httpd.
  If you have hand written /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinet.d/* entry for
  previous version, please change the binary name.

  The package now installs /etc/inetd.conf entry automatically, but only
  if it is not yet occupied by another 'www' entry.
