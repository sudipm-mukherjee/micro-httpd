.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
micro-httpd is a very small \s-1HTTP\s0 server all in 150 lines of code. It
runs from inetd, which means its performance is poor. But for
low-traffic sites, it is quite adequate. It implements all the basic
features of an \s-1HTTP\s0 server, including:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    *  Security against ".." filename snooping.
\&    *  The common MIME types.
\&    *  Trailing\-slash redirection.
\&    *  index.html
\&    *  Directory listings.
.Ve
.PP
To install it, add a line like this to /etc/inetd.conf:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    micro\-http  stream tcp nowait nobody \e
\&       /usr/sbin/micro\-httpd micro\-httpd dir
.Ve
.PP
Make sure the path to the executable is correct, and change \*(L"dir\*(R" to
be the directory you want to serve. You could add line like this to
/etc/services:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    micro\-http   port/tcp   #Micro HTTP server
.Ve
.PP
Change \*(L"port\*(R" to the port number you want to use: 80, 8000, whatever.
Restart inetd by sending it a \*(L"\s-1HUP\s0\*(R" signal.
.PP
On some systems, inetd has a maximum spawn rate \- if you try to run
inetd services faster than a certain number of times per minute, it
assumed there is either a bug of an attack going on and it shuts down
for a few minutes. If you run into this problem \- look for syslog
messages about too-rapid looping \- you will need to find out how to
increase the limit. Unfortunately this varies from \s-1OS\s0 to \s-1OS\s0. On
FreeBSD, you add a \*(L"\-R 10000\*(R" flag to inetd's initial command line. On
some Linux systems, you can set the limit on a per-service basis in
inetd.conf, by changing \*(L"nowait\*(R" to \*(L"nowait.10000\*(R".
.PP
Note that you can use micro-httpd to serve \s-1HTTPS\s0, if you like, by
running it from stunnel. First fetch and install stunnel \- FreeBSD
users can just go to /usr/ports/security/stunnel and do a \*(L"make cert ;
make install\*(R". Then as root run:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    stunnel \-p /usr/local/certs/stunnel.pem \-d 443 \-l \e
\&       /usr/sbin/micro\-httpd \-\-  micro\-httpd dir
.Ve
.PP
Make sure the paths to the certificate and executable are correct, and
again don not forget to change \*(L"dir\*(R" to the directory you want to
serve.
