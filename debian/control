Description: really small HTTP server
 micro_httpd is a very small Unix-based HTTP server. It runs from inetd, which
 means its performance is poor. But for low-traffic sites, it's quite adequate.
 It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:
 .
   * Security against ".." filename snooping
   * The common MIME types
   * Trailing-slash redirection
   * index.html
   * Directory listings
 .
 All in 150 lines of code.
 micro_httpd can also be used to serve HTTPS by wrapping it with stunnel.
