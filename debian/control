Description: really small HTTP server
 A very small Unix-based HTTP server. It runs from inetd, which means its
 performance is poor. But for low-traffic sites, it's quite adequate. It
 implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:
 .
   * Security against ".." filename snooping.
   * The common MIME types.
   * Trailing-slash redirection.
   * index.html
   * Directory listings.
 .
 All in 150 lines of code.
 micro-httpd can also be used to serve HTTPS by wrapping it with stunnel.
